[2025-06-20 21:13:06] - Webscraper Issue Diagnosed

## Current Focus
- Debugging webscraper functionality showing 0 scrapes and SerpAPI not working
- Identified missing environment variable configuration in Vercel deployment
- SerpAPI key exists locally but not configured in production environment

## Issue Resolution
- Root cause: SERPAPI_KEY environment variable not configured in Vercel
- System falling back to limited fallback search instead of real web scraping
- Solution: Add SERPAPI_KEY to Vercel environment variables and redeploy

[2025-06-27 15:27:13] - **RESEARCH AGENT STALLING ISSUE DIAGNOSED**

## Current Focus
- Identified root cause of research agent stalling at final step (step 5/6)
- Issue stems from Server-Sent Events (SSE) controller state management problems
- Race conditions and incomplete error handling causing process to hang indefinitely

## Root Cause Analysis
- **Primary Issue**: SSE ReadableStream controller premature closure with continued event sending attempts
- **Secondary Issues**: Missing timeout handling, incomplete error recovery, frontend stream processing gaps
- **Symptom**: Research completes backend processing but frontend never receives 'complete' event

## Technical Details
- Controller state management has race conditions despite existing `controllerClosed` flag
- No timeout mechanisms for long-running research operations (can exceed 60+ seconds)
- Frontend stream processing lacks timeout detection and recovery
- Error handling attempts to send events to closed controllers, causing silent failures

## Immediate Solutions Required
1. Enhanced controller state management with proper closure detection
2. Stream timeout handling on both frontend and backend (60s backend, 120s frontend)
3. Heartbeat mechanism to detect dead connections
4. Proper error recovery and user feedback for failed streams
