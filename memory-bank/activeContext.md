# Active Context

This file tracks the project's current status, including recent changes, current goals, and open questions.
2025-06-20 13:52:31 - Initial Memory Bank creation and context establishment.

## Current Focus

* Memory Bank initialization for research agent project
* Establishing project documentation and context tracking system
* Research agent is currently operational with insurance plan research capabilities

## Recent Changes

* 2025-06-20 13:52:31 - Memory Bank system being initialized
* Research API appears to be actively processing insurance-related queries (Aetna plan research visible in terminal)
* Development server running and functional

## Open Questions/Issues

* Need to understand full scope of research capabilities beyond insurance plans
* Determine if additional research domains are planned
* Assess current API rate limits and performance characteristics
* Evaluate need for additional research data sources or integrations
