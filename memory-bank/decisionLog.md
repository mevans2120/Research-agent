[2025-06-20 14:33:44] - Pertinent Results Filtering and Enhanced Formatting Feature Design

## Decision
Design and architect a feature that filters research results for relevance and adds structured formatting (tables and bullet points) to improve result quality and readability.

## Rationale
- Current system returns all research findings regardless of relevance to the original query
- Users need more focused, pertinent results rather than comprehensive but potentially irrelevant information
- Unstructured text output is difficult to scan and digest quickly
- Tables and bullet points improve readability and information organization
- Enhanced formatting supports different types of information (comparisons, lists, data)

## Implementation Details
- **Relevance Scoring System**: Use Claude to score each finding's pertinence (0-100) with configurable threshold filtering
- **Structured Formatting Engine**: Enhanced AI prompts to generate tables, bullet points, and mixed formats
- **Adaptive Format Selection**: Automatically determine optimal format based on content type
- **Enhanced API**: New request parameters for relevance threshold and format preferences
- **Performance Optimization**: Token efficiency through pre-filtering and parallel processing
- **User Controls**: Frontend options for format selection and relevance threshold adjustment
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when relevance analysis or formatting fails
[2025-06-20 14:43:54] - SSE Controller Error Handling Fix

## Decision
Fixed Server-Sent Events (SSE) controller error handling to prevent "Controller is already closed" errors during streaming research operations.

## Rationale
- The streaming research was failing when errors occurred because the error handler tried to use an already-closed SSE controller
- This caused the research process to crash instead of gracefully handling errors
- Proper error handling ensures robust streaming operations and better user experience
- Critical for production stability of the enhanced research features

## Implementation Details
- Added try-catch blocks around controller operations in error handler
- Separated error message sending from controller closing operations
- Added specific error logging for controller state issues
- Ensured graceful degradation when controller operations fail
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing streaming functionality

## Technical Impact
- Eliminates "TypeError: Invalid state: Controller is already closed" errors
- Improves reliability of real-time streaming research activities
- Enables proper error reporting to frontend during streaming operations
- Supports robust operation of new relevance filtering and enhanced formatting features
[2025-06-20 14:50:32] - Enhanced Markdown Display Feature Architecture Design

## Decision
Design a comprehensive markdown display feature that allows the research agent to write structured markdown content and render it with rich formatting to significantly improve search result presentation and readability.

## Rationale
- Current system has basic markdown capabilities but lacks comprehensive formatting for complex research results
- Users need better visual organization of research findings with hierarchical structure, interactive elements, and enhanced readability
- Research results often contain diverse content types (tables, lists, citations, code) that benefit from specialized markdown rendering
- Enhanced formatting improves information consumption, retention, and actionability of research findings
- Structured markdown enables better content navigation, search within results, and export capabilities

## Implementation Details
- **Enhanced Markdown Engine**: Full markdown specification support with research-specific extensions for citations, relevance indicators, and source attribution
- **Intelligent Content Structuring**: AI-driven analysis for automatic section detection, hierarchical organization, and cross-reference linking
- **Interactive Elements**: Collapsible sections, tabbed content, expandable details, and dynamic table-of-contents navigation
- **Visual Enhancement System**: Syntax highlighting, custom research-specific CSS themes, and responsive design optimization
- **Integration Strategy**: New API parameters for markdown complexity levels, streaming integration with real-time formatting progress
- **Performance Optimization**: Lazy loading, client-side caching, chunked processing for large documents
- **Accessibility Features**: Screen reader support, keyboard navigation, and high-contrast mode compatibility
- **User Experience**: Reading mode, customizable themes, typography controls, and search-within-results functionality
[2025-01-21 06:26:25] - **CRITICAL BUG FIX: SSE Controller State Management**
- **Issue**: Research process hanging at step 5/6 due to "Controller is already closed" errors in Server-Sent Events streaming
- **Root Cause**: SSE ReadableStream controller was being closed prematurely (likely due to client disconnect/timeout), but code continued trying to send events to closed controller
- **Solution**: Added controller state management with `controllerClosed` flag and proper error handling
- **Changes Made**:
  - Added `controllerClosed` boolean flag to track controller state
  - Wrapped `controller.enqueue()` calls in try-catch blocks
  - Added state checking before attempting to send events
  - Improved error handling for controller operations
- **Result**: Research process now completes successfully (POST /api/research?stream=true 200 in 32028ms)
- **Files Modified**: `src/app/api/research/route.ts` (lines 722-820)
